## 🔍 Project Name

**NeuroCollab** – Real-time Collaborative Workspace with AI Superpowers


## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

**NeuroCollab** is an advanced, real-time collaborative platform designed for teams working on complex documents, research, and code. It empowers users to co-edit content seamlessly while leveraging the power of AI (like GPT-4) for intelligent assistance, brainstorming, and automation.

The platform is a hybrid between **Notion**, **Google Docs**, and **ChatGPT**, with a heavy focus on **real-time collaboration**, **presence tracking**, and **AI-enhanced productivity**. It is intended to push the boundaries of team collaboration beyond passive document sharing into an active, synchronous, and smart environment.


## 👥 Who It’s For

* **Tech teams** writing specifications, docs, or architectural plans
* **AI researchers** or ML teams collaborating on notebooks and experiments
* **Startup teams** who need a fast, smart, and minimal collaborative editor
* **Remote-first teams** seeking a modern, AI-augmented productivity suite


## 🧱 Key Features

* ✅ **Multi-user collaboration**: Live document editing with cursor presence
* ✅ **Workspace system**: Teams and permissions for organized collaboration
* ✅ **Document management**: Rich markdown-based documents
* ✅ **AI Assistant**: Inline GPT-4 tools for summarizing, rewriting, explaining, and generating code
* ✅ **Real-time chat**: Team messaging integrated with the workspace
* ✅ **Comments**: Threaded, document-anchored discussions
* ✅ **Live presence**: See who's online and what they're editing
* ✅ **Socket-based syncing**: Fast, real-time updates using WebSockets (Socket.IO)
* ✅ **Cloud-native**: Hosted via a monorepo for frontend/backend/types integration

| Database      | MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)                         |
| DevOps        | Turborepo + PNPM + Docker                      |
| Shared Logic  | Monorepo `packages/shared` (types, utils, zod) |


## 🔄 Why This Project?

> Most collaboration tools today are either real-time but dumb (like Google Docs), or smart but not collaborative (like ChatGPT). NeuroCollab unifies both worlds.

* **Push productivity forward** by letting users ask AI in real-time about shared documents
* **Enable deep work in teams** without switching between tools
* **Create a foundational platform** for future plugins (voice, whiteboards, coding, planning)


## 📈 Future Vision

* Plugin-based system (custom AI tools, drawing tools, diagramming)
* Native app (Electron + Offline-first mode)
* Multi-modal collaboration (voice, video, code snippets)
* AI fine-tuning per workspace or user


## 🚀 MVP Goal

> Build a minimal, usable version of the app with document editing, live chat, AI assistant, and basic team workspace flow. Focus on collaboration quality and extensibility.
